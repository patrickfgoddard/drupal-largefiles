INTRODUCTION
------------

Simple module to display files of a large size. Size is determined by settings page (/admin/config/system/largefiles), with 2mb by default.

Yes, this is very similar to the built-in Files (/admin/content/files), but this display will only show files larger than your determined size in descending order.

Useful to get a quick glance at large files you may want to address right away.

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

/admin/config/system/largefiles sets the file size you would like to use as a "baseline".
